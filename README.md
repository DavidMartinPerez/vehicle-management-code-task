## Functional description of the application

It is an application of visualisation and administration of vehicles that is composed of 3 main pages:
* The selection of the type of user (User or Admin).
* The visualization of the vehicles.
* The creation and editing of vehicles (only administrator has access).

## Stack

* Angular v19
* Tailwindcss
* NgRx (State management)
* Testing with Karma
* Local Storage (For persistan store on memory, por no usar bbdd)

### As folder structure I have used:
It is based on a folder structure that is divided into 4 blocks.
* Core (Non business logic like Auth, Guards, Local storage service)
* Features (Businnes logic)
* Shared (Shared components)
* Store (all files required for storage like actions, effects, states, selectors or reducers)

### 多Why Tailwindcss vs a component library?
Mainly for time and comfort, I use tailwindcss a lot in my day to day life and I am comfortable with it.
Additionally I have made custom form components, of what I have done with Angular's *Value Accesor* functionality for forms and if I had used a component library I would not have done that part.

### 多Why Local Storage for persist data?
Not having a database, I use local storage to persist the data when the application is refreshed.
Although the offer is Senior Frontend Developer, but having an open mind for the backend, I would have liked to implement a database and consulting it with graphql.

### 多Why karma for testing?
Because the angular 19 version was released last week and I prevented that they may have some compatibility issues with other testing libraries. I work with Jest and Mockito and I feel more like with that duo.

### 多Why Angular 19?
Angular 19 use signal and standalone component for default, so I have used what they recommend from google for this version, implementing Input, Output, Computed, Effect and SelectSignal of ngrx.
I wanted to use the latest version with its latest features as I considered them to be very interesting.
